Most part of this project is published under BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" License.
However, some files from external project which is not under BSD 2-Clause are
in this repository to provide compile-time signature information to javac.

All files in src/api will not be included in final jar.

src/api/java/net/minecraft/launchwrapper/ITweaker.java
is a file copied with appending one line header from
https://github.com/Mojang/LegacyLauncher,
a Minecraft launcher for modding which is under
unknown license but issue#1 looks saying mostly free.

src/api/java/cpw/mods/modlauncher/api/ITransformationService.java
is a file copied with commenting via single-line comment and
replacing method signature without binary breaking changes,
from https://github.com/cpw/modlauncher,
a Minecraft launcher for modern version which is under
GNU Lesser General Public License version 3.

The com/anatawa12/jstack/gui/tools.jar in final distribution is from
JDK built that binary distribution.
OpenJDK is under GNU General Public License version 2 with ClassPath exception.
If it's not from OpenJDK, please contact binary distributor if you want to
know license of tools.jar.

In this project, tools.jar is used to launch jshell on separated process,
not to link and this just call jshell as shell script does so I think
licensing via GPL is not required. If you're professional of GNU GPL
or you're copyright owner of openjdk or other JDKs which this binary distribution
is built on, Please contact binary distributor.
